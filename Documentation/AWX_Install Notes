***********KUBERNETES CLUSTER INSTALLATION *************************

###Install guide to build a kubernetes cluster using mini kuge(short script)
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

###Script START####
1. curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
   sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
   
   
   
####   From a terminal with administrator access (but not logged in as root), run: I added the sudo command beow
2. sudo minikube start


###Interact with your cluster
###f you already have kubectl installed, you can now use it to access your shiny new cluster:

3_A. kubectl get po -A

##Copy
###Alternatively, minikube can download the appropriate version of kubectl and you should be able to use it like this:

3_B.  minikube kubectl -- get po -A


Initially, some services such as the storage-provisioner, may not yet be in a Running state. This is a normal condition during cluster bring-up, and will resolve itself momentarily. For additional insight into your cluster state, minikube bundles the Kubernetes Dashboard, allowing you to get easily acclimated to your new environment:

4.  minikube dashboard


5. Manage your cluster

#Pause Kubernetes without impacting deployed applications:

minikube pause

#Unpause a paused instance:

minikube unpause

#Halt the cluster:

minikube stop

#Change the default memory limit (requires a restart):

minikube config set memory 9001

#Browse the catalog of easily installed Kubernetes services:


#Create a second cluster running an older Kubernetes release:

minikube start -p aged --kubernetes-version=v1.16.1

#Delete all of the minikube clusters:

minikube delete --all
