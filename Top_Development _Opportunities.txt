One of my key development opportunities is to continue strengthening my technical depth in core platforms such as AWS, F5, and Infoblox. While I have made meaningful progress through training and hands-on practice, gaining more real-world experience and achieving upcoming certifications will help me operate with greater independence and contribute at a higher level.

Another area for development is improving efficiency and confidence when working through complex tasks or troubleshooting scenarios. As I continue to build experience, I aim to reduce the amount of guidance needed from senior team members and focus on developing a more structured approach to problem-solving.

Additionally, I see an opportunity to expand my understanding of how different components of our network infrastructure fit together. Building a more holistic view will allow me to anticipate potential impacts, make more informed decisions, and better support cross-team initiatives.

Overall, focusing on these areas will help me continue progressing toward becoming a more versatile, self-sufficient, and impactful member of the team.
